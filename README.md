# âš¾ Bayesball: An Analysis of Batters' Swinging Decision Using Bayesian Modelling

This project explores how Bayesian modeling can be applied to simulate and analyze batter swing decisions in baseball. Inspired by the concept of Bayesian integration in fast-paced perceptual decisions, we aim to understand how prior knowledge and real-time pitch observations influence a batter's swing behavior.

## Notebook

All code, visualizations, and analysis are contained in the Jupyter notebook:

> **[`bayesball_updated.ipynb`](./bayesball_updated.ipynb)**

This notebook walks through:
- Simulating pitch distributions and swing decisions
- Implementing Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation 
- Exploring multi-pitch scenarios and inference strategies
- Findings, strengths and limitations, and future work that can be done along this line
